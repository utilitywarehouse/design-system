## Changesets

Customer UI uses [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for
versioning, publishing and automating changelogs. This means that you need to
add a changeset by running `yarn changeset`, you will then be prompted to select
which package(s) to include in the changeset, and then a bump type from `major`,
`minor` or `patch`, and finally you will need to add a message to be included in
the next release and associated changelog.

Not all changes require changesets, so Pull Requests are not blocked if missing
a changeset, however you may be asked to add one, or one may be added for your
change.
