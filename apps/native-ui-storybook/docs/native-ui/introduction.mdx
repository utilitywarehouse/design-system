- [Installation](#installation)
- [Additional packages](#additional-packages)
- [Theming](#theming)
- [Dark Mode](#dark-mode)

## Installation

Assuming you already have React installed, to get started install the library and it's peer dependencies.

```console
yarn add @utilitywarehouse/native-ui @gluestack-ui/themed @gluestack-style/react react-native-svg@13.4.0
```

## Additional packages

You will need to include the **Aeonik** and **Work Sans** fonts. The
easiest way to do this is to use the `@utilitywarehouse/fontsource` package.

```console
yarn add @utilitywarehouse/fontsource
```

Next, create a react-native.config.js file in the root directory and paste the code below inside it:

```js
module.exports = {
  project: {
    ios: {},
    android: {},
  },
  assets: ['@utilitywarehouse/fontsource/files/truetype'],
};
```

## Theming

Wrap your application with the `ThemeProvider` component.

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { NativeUIProvider } from '@utilitywarehouse/native-ui';
import App from './App';

const App: React.FC = () => (
  <NativeUIProvider>
    <App />
  </NativeUIProviderr>
);
```
