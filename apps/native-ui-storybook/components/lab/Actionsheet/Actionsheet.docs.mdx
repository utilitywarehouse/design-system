# Actionsheet

By providing access to hover, pressed, and focus events, Actionsheet serves as a more flexible alternative to buttons at a lower level of abstraction. It is a useful primitive for advanced customization needs.

## Usage

> This component should be wrapped in a `NativeUIProvider` component to ensure that the correct theme is applied.
