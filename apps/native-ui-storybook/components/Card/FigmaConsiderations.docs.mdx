## A Card _is not_ a Frame

**While a card can be visually represented as a frame in Figma, it serves a much broader purpose.**
It functions as a versatile container component that can hold a variety of interactive and
non-interactive elements, making it a fundamental building block for many UI designs. It is a
fundamental component of Mobile applications.

Here are some reasons why treating cards solely as frames can result in inconsistencies:

**Overriding Styles:** When we view cards merely as frames, we may be tempted to override default styles
to meet specific needs. This can create inconsistencies across different cards, disrupting the
coherence of the design system.

**Redesign:** When Card gets a redesing, as soon as publish, your instances will be updted. If you use
frames this will have to be done manually.

**Incorrect Usage:** A misunderstanding of the card's purpose may lead to misuse, where cards are used
to contain elements that are not intended to be included within a card.

**Creating the same component all the time:** even though a Card is a stateless component, if developers
start creating their own custom cards, this can lead to inconsistencies over time.

There are two ways to use a Card in Figma (details below ðŸ‘‡) . Regardless of the approach, clear and
concise specifications should be provided to developers during handoff.

## Use Card as a Slot Component

To understand what a slot component is, please refer to the documentation.

By default, the card is as a slot component and is highly customisable to meet your design needs. Slot
components help maintain consistency and streamline the design process whenever possible.

Cards are the building blocks of other components, such as lists. Adjusting the card container without
detaching the list is essential. Therefore, keeping some components as slot components is sometimes
necessary rather than detaching them.

**Customisation:** By using the slot component, designers can create a versatile card structure with
customisable content areas. These areas, or "slots," can be populated with different types of content,
such as images, text, or other components.

**Consistency:** When used correctly, slot components ensure consistency across various card instances.
Any changes made to the main element will automatically propagate to all its instances.

Here is is a step by step guide to use Card as a slot component

### Step 1: Define the Card you will use

Establish the core structure of the Card you intend to use. Will it have an outline? What colour will it be,
and will it be nested within another card? Will it contain other cards? To learn about card customisation
options, please [refer to the card properties](/?path=/docs/native-ui-components-card--guidelines#card-style-variants).

In this example, I am using a basic outline card, and I can adjust the card properties later if I am
uncertain about the design.

<img src={cardExample} style={{ maxWidth: '100%' }} />

### Step 2: Define the Card content

Start by clearly defining the content you want to include on the Card in isolation. Will your Card content
text? A Button? Images? Icons?

I am adding a red stroke to the content container so you can see it

<img src={localCard} style={{ maxWidth: '100%' }} />

Once you are happy with the content of the card you can do step 3

### Step 3: Define the Card content

Once you have a clear concept, create a local Figma component using either the underscore (\_) or period (.)
naming convention. Then, add this component to a folder with the .local/ prefix.

Because this is a Figma component you can use properties in it.

<img src={screenshot} style={{ maxWidth: '100%' }} />
<br />
<br />
<img src={localCard} style={{ maxWidth: '100%' }} />

### Step 4: Assemble the Card

After preparing your content component, you can swap the instance of that component in the Card you initially
selected, using the Card props.

This will keep both components together without detaching anything.

You can do that at the end, once you know the Card's content.

<img src={localCard} style={{ maxWidth: '100%' }} />
<br />
<br />
<img src={cardExample} style={{ maxWidth: '100%' }} />
<br />
<br />
<img src={swap} style={{ maxWidth: '100%' }} />
<br />
<br />
<img src={chooseLocal} style={{ maxWidth: '100%' }} />
<br />
<br />
<img src={contentWillAppear} style={{ maxWidth: '100%' }} />

### Customise it

You can further customise the Card to fit your content and context.

- Additionally, **you can customise any other components used within the Card**, such as the Button in this case.
- Because the Card content is now a component, you can use all the power of figma props in them.

<img src={cards} style={{ maxWidth: '100%' }} />
<br />
<br />
<DocComponentWrap>
  <Card colorScheme="purple" padding="large">
    <Heading
      color="$purple900"
      style={{ marginBottom: 8 }}
      children={['Using the same local component']}
    />
    <Text
      children={[
        'This component has boolean properties that control the visibility of elements. Both the cat and the button are hidden using these boolean properties.',
      ]}
    />
  </Card>
</DocComponentWrap>

### Handoff

When nothing is detached, there is no need for an extra handoff as the developer can use Code Connect to inspect all
the Card props and replicate your design using Card from the code library as a container.

Developers can focus on creating the content that will go into the Card.

<img src={codeConnect} style={{ maxWidth: '100%' }} />

## Use Card as a Detached Component Instance

Detaching a Card instance first, before adding the content. allows for more design and layout freedom and can feel
more natural because you treat it as a Figma frame.

However, it's crucial to maintain the visual design elements of the Card, such as padding, borders, color choices,
and the border radius. Ensure that you respect these design aspects and avoid any overrides.

In this example, both Card and card content are detached.

<img src={allDetached} style={{ maxWidth: '100%' }} />

### Handoff

Even when you detached all components and use frames instead, you need to add the component in the handoff, all the
different Cards that you used so the developers can inspect the component.

When Card is detached they won't be able to see Code Connect or the properties that you used.

Leaving the original component intact with a note in the handoff helps developers understand the component's intended
structure and potential variations.

<img src={haveDetached} style={{ maxWidth: '100%' }} />
<br />
<br />
<img src={detached} style={{ maxWidth: '100%' }} />
<br />
<br />
<img src={handoff} style={{ maxWidth: '100%' }} />
<br />
<br />
<img src={codeConnect2} style={{ maxWidth: '100%' }} />

### Start by detaching and then use the Slot

Alternatively, you can start by detaching the card, and once you are prepared for the handoff, you can use the Slot
component technique.
