# Design tokens

The design tokens package contains a set of low level design tokens associated
with the [Customer UI design system](https://utilitywarehouse.invisionapp.com/dsm/utilitywarehouse/design-system).

The design tokens package isn't intended to be consumed directly, but is a low
level layer for the other packages in the Customer UI namespace.
