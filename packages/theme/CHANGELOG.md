## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [#335](https://github.com/utilitywarehouse/customer-ui/pull/335) [`27250d6`](https://github.com/utilitywarehouse/customer-ui/commit/27250d6c0ec74aaf4f10bd53498d028b5e31b666) Thanks [@robphoenix](https://github.com/robphoenix)! - This change reverts the `level1` backgroundColor for the backdrop theme back to `purple`, from `darkTint`.

  This was originally changed in #197 because of [the DSM](https://utilitywarehouse.invisionapp.com/dsm/utilitywarehouse/web-beta/nav/5fa7cb708c012000183622c4/folder/6086ce784353602d543228dc?mode=preview) at the time.
  This change was then available in the `customer-ui-theme` package from version
  `v1.0.0-alpha.20`, and subsequently in the `customer-ui-material` package from
  version `v1.0.0-alpha.72`

  The [current Design System](https://www.figma.com/file/R3NKpDsHVjcFt9vXqReoKZ/UW-Foundation?node-id=649%3A2),
  does not include `darkTint` but does have `purple`.
