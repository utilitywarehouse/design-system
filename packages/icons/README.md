# Icons

A collection of customer UI svg icons. Each icon consists of a single colour which can be recoloured on the CSS class `customer-ui__icon` using `fill`. Icons are organised by size.

## Adding icons

When adding icons make sure the fill colour of the icon is inherited from the fill property on the `<svg />` tag. This allows for overriding the fill colour at the top level of the SVG in consuming libraries.
