## Installation

Assuming you already have React installed, to get started install the library and it's peer dependencies.

```console
yarn add @utilitywarehouse/web-ui @mui/material
```

## Fonts

You will also need to include the **Aeonik** and **Work Sans** fonts. The
easiest way to do this is to use the `@utilitywarehouse/fontsource` package.

```console
yarn add @utilitywarehouse/fontsource
```

## Theming

Start by wrapping your application with the `ThemeProvider` component.

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider } from '@utilitywarehouse/web-ui';
import App from './App';

const App: React.FC = () => (
  <ThemeProvider>
    <App />
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

## ES modules

In an effort to provide a tree-shakeable library we export bundles for both ES modules and CommonJS. This however may cause issues with Webpack based applications as they default to expecting ES module files to be referenced with a file extension.

### Plain React App

If you are using Web UI in a plain React app, you can update [this rule](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#resolvefullyspecified).

```js
{
  test: /\.m?js/,
  resolve: {
    fullySpecified: false,
  },
},
```

### Create React App

If you are using Create React App the process is almost the same, but you will
have to install `react-app-rewired` (or any other package that let's you edit
the build process). In this [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/70720290) you can see exactly what
is needed (As the example provided solves exactly this issue coincidentally).

### Next.js

If you are using Next.js this won't happen to you as it is handled by the framework.

## Dark Mode

It should be noted that there is no intention to support dark mode for web.
