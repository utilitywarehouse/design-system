# UW Web UI

React component library for building UW Web UIs.

Current version: v{version}

## Installation

Assuming you already have React installed, to get started install the library and it's peer dependencies.

```console
yarn add @utilitywarehouse/web-ui @mui/material
```

## Fonts

You will also need to include the **Aeonik** and **Work Sans** fonts. The
easiest way to do this is to use the `@utilitywarehouse/fontsource` package.

```console
yarn add @utilitywarehouse/fontsource
```

## Theming

Start by wrapping your application with the `ThemeProvider` component.

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider } from '@utilitywarehouse/web-ui';
import App from './App';

const App: React.FC = () => (
  <ThemeProvider>
    <App />
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

## Dark Mode

It should be noted that there is no intention to support dark mode for web.

## Next.js

Please note that it is currently not possible to use Web UI with Next.js v12.
