## Installation

Assuming you already have React installed, to get started install the library and it's peer dependencies.

```console
yarn add @utilitywarehouse/web-ui @mui/material
```

## Additional packages

You will need to include the **Aeonik** and **Work Sans** fonts. The
easiest way to do this is to use the `@utilitywarehouse/fontsource` package.

```console
yarn add @utilitywarehouse/fontsource
```

We also recommend you use the `@utilitywarehouse/css-reset` package as Web UI does
not include a CSS reset by default.

```console
yarn add @utilitywarehouse/css-reset
```

If using, import both packages in the root of your application.

```js
import '@utilitywarehouse/css-reset';
import '@utilitywarehouse/fontsource';
```

## Theming

Newer components do not need to be wrapped in a `ThemeProvider` component.
Individual component documentation will indicate when a component requires the
`ThemeProvider`. Only the following components should be wrapped in the
`ThemeProvider`:

- `Grid`
- `Menu` (& `MenuItem`)
- `TextField`
- `Link` & `TextLink` (deprecated)
- `Stack`
- `ToggleButtonGroup` (& `ToggleButton`)

Wrap your application with the `ThemeProvider` component.

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider } from '@utilitywarehouse/web-ui';
import App from './App';

const App: React.FC = () => (
  <ThemeProvider>
    <App />
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

Or if necessary wrap only specific components with the `ThemeProvider`.

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider, TextField } from '@utilitywarehouse/web-ui';
import App from './App';

const CustomInput: React.FC = () => (
  <ThemeProvider>
    <TextField />
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

All other components can be used without being wrapped in a `ThemeProvider`,
and will nnot be affected if wrapped in a `ThemeProvider` from another
component library, including the deprecated `customer-ui-material`.

## The `lab` submodule

In an effort to avoid blocking the UX team, at the same time as avoiding
forcing breaking changes on dev teams, we use the `lab` submodule to add
component updates when necessary. for instance, if significant design updates,
required by product, also incur breaking api changes, or a complete refactor,
we can introduce them via the `lab` import path, alongside the existing
component. components introduced in this way can then replace the existing
component in the next major release.

After being released, components within `lab` will still be subject to semantic
releasing, so any breaking changes will be considered as just that and will
require a major release.

```tsx
import { Button } from '@utilitywarehouse/web-ui/dist/lab';

[...]

<Button>New button</Button>
```

## ES modules

In an effort to provide a tree-shakeable library we export bundles for both ES
modules and CommonJS. This however may cause issues with Webpack based
applications as they default to expecting ES module files to be referenced with
a file extension.

### Plain React App

If you are using Web UI in a plain React app, you can update [this rule](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#resolvefullyspecified).

```js
{
  test: /\.m?js/,
  resolve: {
    fullySpecified: false,
  },
},
```

### Create React App

If you are using Create React App the process is almost the same, but you will
have to install `react-app-rewired` (or any other package that let's you edit
the build process). In this [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/70720290) you can see exactly what
is needed (As the example provided solves exactly this issue coincidentally).

### Next.js

If you are using Next.js this won't happen to you as it is handled by the framework.

## Dark Mode

It should be noted that there is no intention to support dark mode for web.
