# v0

It is possible to use Web UI in an application which is currently using
`customer-ui-material`. While you probably don't want to use components from both
libraries side-by-side,

this is no longer true - make it apparent that this only applies to certain components - as long as any Web UI are children of a `ThemeProvider`
from Web UI then you can do this at the most specific level you want, whether
that is app-wide, for a single page, or for a single section or component.

## Codemods
