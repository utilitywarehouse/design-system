# Migration Guide

It is possible to use Web UI in an application which is currently using
Customer Web UI. While you probably don't want to use components from both
libraries side-by-side, as long as any Web UI are children of a `ThemeProvider`
from Web UI then you can do this at the most specific level you want, whether
that is app-wide, for a single page, or for a single section or component.
