## sx prop

The `sx` prop is great for applying one-off styles. It is based on the
[emotion `css` prop](https://emotion.sh/docs/css-prop)
and [Theme UI's own `sx` prop](https://theme-ui.com/sx-prop/).
It utilises a superset of CSS, so you can use the full breadth of
regular CSS, as well as responsive values and _theme-aware_ properties.

The `sx` prop also helps to maintain the separation of concerns between CSS
utilities and component business logic. It is used as an _escape-hatch_ on all
components imported from Web UI, so that it is possible to override default
styling if necessary.

```tsx
<Box
  sx={{
    boxShadow: 1, // theme.shadows[1]
    color: 'colors.apple400', // theme.palette.colors.apple400
    margin: 1, // margin: theme.spacing(1)
    paddingX: 2, // paddingLeft: theme.spacing(2) & paddingRight: theme.spacing(2)
    zIndex: 'tooltip', // theme.zIndex.tooltip
    borderRadius: 2, // theme.shape.borderRadius * 2
  }}
>
```

## System properties

The [MUI system properties](https://mui.com/system/properties/) are available on the following components:

- `Box`
- `Grid`
- `Stack`
- `Typography`

These components are designed to solve CSS problems - they are CSS component
utilities. Props on custom components from Web UI exist to address component
logic, and styling is therefore restricted to the `sx` prop.

```tsx
<Box
  margin={2}
  padding={4}
  minWidth={300}
  color={colors.grey200}
>
```

## Styled utility

The `styled()` utility is based on the same utility from [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
and [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled) and is how MUI styles it's own
components. It is great for building components that need to support a wide
variety of contexts or that may be used in multiple places.

This basic example shows how to use `styled`

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { styled } from '@utilitywarehouse/web-ui';
import { colorsCommon } from '@utilitywarehouse/colour-system';

const StyledContainer = styled('div')(({theme}) => {
  color: colorsCommon.brandMidnight,
  backgroundColor: colorsCommon.brandWhite,
  padding: theme.spacing(2),
});

export default function App() {
  return <StyledContainer>Styled container</StyledContainer>;
}
```

### Caveats

1. Certain shorthand property values are not supported in the `styled` utility;
   for instance `marginX`, `marginY`, `paddingX`, `paddingY`.
1. You need to explicitly reference the `theme.spacing` utility; `padding: 2`
   will become `padding: '2px'`, in styled whereas it will be `padding: '16px'`
   in `sx`.

## Responsive values

Both the system properties and `sx` prop can define responsive styles in a
couple of ways without having to define media queries. You can set these
values, which will respond to our custom breakpoints, as an array or an object.

```tsx
<Box
  sx={{
    width: {
      mobile: 100, // theme.breakpoints.up('mobile')
      tablet: 200, // theme.breakpoints.up('tablet')
      desktop: 300, // theme.breakpoints.up('desktop')
      wide: 400, // theme.breakpoints.up('wide')
    },
  }}
>
  This box has a responsive width.
</Box>

[...]

<Box sx={{ width: [100, 200, 300, 400] }}>This box has a responsive width.</Box>
// You can skip breakpoints with the null value:
<Box sx={{ width: [null, null, 300, null] }}>This box has a responsive width.</Box>
```

Be aware that these responsive values take a mobile-first approach, and are set
for the specific breakpoint upwards. For instance, setting a value for just the
`mobile` breakpoint will set it for all screen widths, you would need to set
the value again at a wider breakpoint if you don't want this,
ie: `padding: {{ mobile: 2, desktop: 0 }}`

## Guidelines

We recommend **clarity over brevity**.

### Avoid using shorthand property names

`paddingTop` is a lot more explicit, and less confusing, than `pt`.

```tsx
<Box
  // prefer a properties full name
  marginTop={2}
  // over the shorthand property
  mt={2}
  // in the sx prop also
  sx={{
    // prefer this
    padding: 1,
    // over this
    p: 1,
  }}
/>
```

### Prefer the object syntax for responsive values

```tsx
<Box
  // prefer object syntax
  marginTop={{
    mobile: 2,
    tablet: 2,
    desktop: 4,
    wide: 4,
  }}
  // over the array syntax
  marginTop={[2, 2, 4, 4]}
  // intentions are also clearer when you want to miss out breakpoints
  marginTop={{ mobile: 2, desktop: 4 }}
/>
```
