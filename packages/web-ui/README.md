#  UW Web UI

React component library for building UW Web UIs.

This library started life as *Customer Web UI*, a library for building UW's
customer account applications, and has since been refactored to meet the needs
of multiple customer and partner focused web applications. This has been done
in close collaboration with the UX design team, and with a renewed focus on
accessibility.

This library is focused on building UIs for UW branded products, and is not
intended to be used, nor will be supported, outside this ecosystem.

## Design

The design source for these components is available in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/4FFYTLWJ2hQpj36JplQQUw/UW-Web-UI---MASTER?node-id=38%3A885&mode=dev), though you will need the required permissions to view these files.

## Getting Started

Please have a look at [the documentation we have in Storybook](https://uw-web-ui.vercel.app/?path=/docs/web-ui-introduction--documentation) for how to get
started using this library.

Please note the need for the UW fontsource library, and the Web UI `ThemeProvider`
component.
