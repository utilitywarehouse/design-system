# Heading

Heading renders the primary UW font, to be used for heading-level typography.

The system props are not available on the Heading component, if you need custom typography then use the [Typography](?path=/docs/components-typography--documentation) component.
If necessary you can use `sx` as an escape hatch for one-off custom styling.

## Alternatives

- [Text](?path=/docs/components-text--documentation) - For body text
- [Typography](?path=/docs/components-typography--documentation) - For custom typography

## Semantic HTML

The `component` prop is required for this component, encouraging you to consider the correct semantic element.
