# Button

A Button should be used for actions. It can be used on all available background colours.

## Semantic HTML

By default Button renders a `button` element, however if you pass a valid `href` prop then a `a` element will be rendered.
You are still able to use the `onClick` prop, for example to track the usage of the link.

```tsx
<Button href="https://uw.co.uk" onClick={handleAnchorUsage}>...</Box>
```

## Variants

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Variants" />
</Canvas>

## Sizes

The tertiary Button has only one size and is not affected by the `size` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Sizes" />
</Canvas>

## Capitalization

By default Button will render the label with only the first word capitalized. If you need to render text with different capitalization you can first set the `disableCapitalizeFirstLetter` prop to `true`.

```tsx
<Button disableCapitalizeFirstLetter>PLEASE CLICK ME!</Button>
```
