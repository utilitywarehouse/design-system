## Accessibility

Follows the [WAI-ARIA Radio Group Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/radio/) for radio groups not contained in a toolbar.

> **NOTE**
> The initial focus behaviour when using `Shift+Tab` to move focus into the
> radio group, if none of the radio buttons are selected, reflects the native
> browser behaviour, rather than that described in the WAI-ARIA pattern, as it
> focuses the last radio button in the group, rather than the first.

The necessary aria props, such as `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby` and
`aria-errormessage` are handled internally, however you can pass these and
other aria props, such as `aria-label`, to the `RadioGroup` and `Radio`
components yourself if you need to.

### Known Issues

The current focus indicator for the `Radio` component does not meet AA colour
contrast standards, and the focus styles for the `RadioTile` are being reviewed
to ensure they are accessible. This is being worked on by the Design Systems team.

### Keyboard interactions

  {[
    {

    },
    {

    },

      description: 'Moves focus and checks the previous radio item in the group.',
    },
  ].map(kbi => (
    <Box display="flex" alignItems="baseline">
      <Box width={300}>
        <kbd>{kbi.key}</kbd>
      </Box>
      <Text component="span" variant="body">
        {kbi.description}
      </Text>
    </Box>
  ))}
</Stack>

## Helper text

The Radio group can display a secondary message as a helper text. This can be
either above or below the group's radio items. While the radio items can also
display a helper text, these will not be displayed if the radio group has a
helper text.

<Canvas of={RadioGroupStories.WithRadioHelperText} />

## Error message

In general, radio buttons should have a value selected by default. If this is
not the case, you can display an error if no value is selected when the form is
submitted.

<Canvas of={RadioGroupStories.ShowingError} sourceState="none" />

## Width

The width of the `RadioGroup` should be set by the parent layout, however it is
possible to independently set the width of the children using `contentWidth`
prop. This property is most useful when using the `RadioGroup` with the
`RadioTile` component.

By default it will set the width of the children to fit their content, however
you can set it to a specific width, or to `100%` to take up the full width of
the `RadioGroup`.

This is a responsive property, so you are able to set different widths for
different breakpoints.

## Columns

You can use the `columns` prop to display the RadioGroup's child elements in
columns rather than a flat column or row, by setting the number of columns you
need.

<Canvas of={RadioGroupStories.Columns} />

## Controlled

A controlled value can be provided using the value prop, which accepts a value
corresponding with the value prop of each `Radio`. The onChange event is fired
when the user selects a `Radio`.

<Canvas of={RadioGroupStories.Controlled} sourceState="shown"
source={{
code: `
const [selected, setSelected] = useState('')

[...]

<RadioGroup
  value={selected}
  onChange={setSelected}
  helperText={'The selected value is: ' + selected}
>
  <Radio value="1">One</Radio>
  <Radio value="2">Two</Radio>
  <Radio value="3">Three</Radio>
</RadioGroup>
`, }} />

## RadioGroup props

<ArgTypes of={RadioGroupStories} />

## Radio & RadioTile

The `Radio` & `RadioTile` components should be used within a `RadioGroup` component.

### Accessibility

The `Radio` and `RadioTile` are, by default, appropriately labelled using it's
children, if you do not provide children, you must specify an `aria-label` for
accessibility.
