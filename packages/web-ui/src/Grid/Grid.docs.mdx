# Grid

A responsive layout grid adapts to screen size and orientation, ensuring consistency across layouts.

## How it works

The grid system is implemented with the Grid component:

- It uses CSS's Flexible Box module for high flexibility.
- There are two types of layout: containers and items.
- Item widths are set in percentages, so they're always fluid and sized relative to their parent element.
- Items have padding to create the spacing between individual items.
- There are five grid breakpoints: xs, sm, md, lg, and xl.
- Integer values can be given to each breakpoint, indicating how many of the 12 available columns are occupied by the component when the viewport width satisfies the breakpoint constraints.
