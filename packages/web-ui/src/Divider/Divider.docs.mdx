## Accessibility

Follows the [Separator role requirements](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#separator).

By default the `Divider` component renders a `div` with a role of `separator`.
This is a semantically meaningful division between elements, and should be used
considerately.
If you need a purely visual separation you can use the `decorative` prop, which
will remove the element from the accessibility tree. Alternatively you could
use CSS styling, such as `border-color`, instead of this component.

```tsx
<Divider decorative />
```

## Custom colour

If necessary you can override the default colour using the `color` prop. We
recommend you use the `@utilitywarehouse/colour-system` library for this.

```tsx
import { Divider } from "@utilitywarehouse/web-ui";
import { colors } from "@utilitywarehouse/colour-system";

[...]

<Divider color={colors.pink500} />
```

<Canvas of={Stories.CustomColor} />

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />
