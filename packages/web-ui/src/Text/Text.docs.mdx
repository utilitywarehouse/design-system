# Text

Text renders the secondary UW font, Work Sans, to be used for body copy.

The system props are not available on the Text component, if you need custom typography then use the [Typography](?path=/docs/components-typography--documentation) component.
If necessary you can use `sx` as an escape hatch for one-off custom styling.

## Alternatives

- [Heading](?path=/docs/components-heading--documentation) - For heading-level text
- [Typography](?path=/docs/components-typography--documentation) - For custom typography

## Semantic HTML

The `component` prop is required for this component, encouraging you to consider the correct semantic element.
