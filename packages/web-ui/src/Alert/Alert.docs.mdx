## Color schemes

The `colorScheme` prop will change the Alert colours.

```tsx
<Alert
  colorScheme="red"
  title="Something went wrong"
  text="Please refresh your browser or come back later"
/>
```

For now, we have adopted a presentational naming convention here, rather than
associating semantics with the different colour schemes. This is only because
we're not ready yet to properly define these semantics within the the colour
system, across all components, and product applications.

However you can imply some familiar semantics, which could be considered as
`severity` or `tone`;

- `cyan` -> `information`
- `green` -> `success`
- `gold` -> `warning`
- `red` -> `error`

## Accessibility

The `Alert` component should be used sparingly. It has an ARIA role of `alert`,
used to communicate an important and usually time-sensitive message to the
user. The browser will send out an accessible alert event to assistive
technology products which can then notify the user.

The `alert` role is for content that is dynamically displayed, not for content
that appears on page load. If an alert is present on page load, it wonâ€™t be
read automatically by screenreaders, and is not technically an alert.

To display the `Alert` component, use either conditional rendering or
dynamically alter the CSS `display` property in your React code.

```tsx
[...]

const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);
const handleOpen = () => setOpen(true);
const handleClose = () => setOpen(false);

[...]

return (
  <Flex direction="column" gap={2} width="fit-content">

    <Button size="small" variant="outline" onClick={handleOpen}>
      Open alert
    </Button>

    {/* conditionally render */}
    {open ? (
      <Alert direction="row" text="This is for your information." onClose={handleClose} />
    ) : null}

    {/* or, dynamically alter `display` */}
    <Box display={open ? 'block' : 'none'}>
      <Alert direction="row" text="This is for your information." onClose={handleClose} />
    </Box>

  </Flex>
);
```

## Advanced usage

You can use the elements of a `Alert` separately for advanced usage for example changing the alert text:

```tsx
import { Alert, AlertTitle, AlertText, AlertLink, Strong } from '@utilitywarehouse/web-ui';

const YourComponent = () => (
  <Alert colorScheme="red">
    <AlertTitle>Alert title</AlertTitle>
    <AlertText>
      Alert text <Strong>purus odio</Strong>, maximus tincidunt aliquet posuere, mollis ut mauris.
    </AlertText>
    <AlertLink href="#">Alert link</AlertLink>
  </Alert>
);
```
