The Button component is highly flexible, and features various style variants,
colorSchemes, and other configurations to adapt to a wide range of design use
cases and compositions.

## Accessibility

- **If it does something it's a button, if it goes somewhere it's a link.**
- If you need help deciding which component works best for your content, please refer to the [global usage guidelines](https://wiki.uw.systems/posts/buttons-links-and-icon-buttons-guidelines-fs09gshh).
- All buttons, except solid cyan, meet WCAG AA colour contrast standards on a white background.
- Text within a button is also crucial for [accessibility and usability](https://wiki.uw.systems/posts/buttons-links-and-icon-buttons-guidelines-fs09gshh).

## Variants

Buttons, like many other components, come in pre-designed variants. For more
information on style variant concepts, refer to the [naming convention doc](https://wiki.uw.systems/posts/naming-conventions-and-stack-mirroring-z1olqysr#hco7u-variants).

The Button component offers a set of variants to address a wide variety of use
cases. Each variant provides control over its appearance, including elements
like borders, background colour, and foreground colours.

The choice of Button variant depends on several factors:

- Where does the button appear in the user flow?
- The importance of the action within that context
- How does the button interact with other elements on the screen?

### Solid

Solid Buttons are ideal for primary actions in screens or compositions that
require high visual emphasis. Their appearance creates a strong presence,
making them perfect for highlighting the main action especially when combined
with other Button variants to create a clear visual hierarchy within a
composition.

Solid buttons are ideal for submitting data in forms, such as
submitting an application or finalising a purchase.

### Outline

Outline Buttons offer a moderate level of emphasis, making them suitable for
secondary or non-critical actions like "Cancel" or "Edit." To enhance the
meaning and purpose of the action further, these buttons can be combined with
any colorScheme from our design system.

### Ghost

Ghost buttons are a subtle button variant designed to have a low visual presence compared to other Button variants.

Ghost buttons start out with a transparent look, only becoming fully visible when a user interacts with them.
Typical use cases of the ghost variant are:

- Suitable for actions that are less important than the primary one on a screen:
- Ghost buttons excel at complementing solid and outlined Buttons by providing additional actions without overwhelming users.
- Their simple design makes them ideal as building blocks for other UI components that require user interaction, such as Input, Tiles, Calendar, etc.

To enhance the meaning and purpose of the action further, these buttons can be combined with any colorScheme from our design system.

## Best Practices

- For clarity, use clear and concise Button text that accurately reflects the action it triggers.
- Provide visual hierarchy; use button sizes, colours, and variants according to importance and meaning.
- Avoid overwhelming users with too many buttons, this can lead to confusion and decision fatigue.
