## Semantic HTML

By default Flex renders a `div` element, this can be customised using the
`component` prop.

```tsx dark
<Flex component="ul" role="list">
  ...
</Flex>
```

## Flex vs. Stack

The `Stack` component was introduced before the flexbox `gap` property was
widely available, and was intended as an intuitive way of building consistently
spaced layouts. It did this by adding additional margin to child components,
which could sometimes cause problems, such as margin collapse on the child
components.

It is now possible to achieve the same layouts using the native
flexbox gap property, and this is our preferred way of achieving these common
_stacked_ layouts.

Currently the only area where the `Stack` component is more
useful, is if you want to include a divider in between your children. This is
not possible using `Flex`, so we recommend using `Stack` in this instance.
