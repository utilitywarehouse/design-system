## Usage

This `Link` component is part of the lab submodule, a way for us to make new
components available prior to an official major release. This helps us bed in
new components before introducing breaking changes, and to avoid blocking the
availability of these components for designers.

There are 2 options for importing this component.

1. Import directly from the `lab` directory.

```tsx
import { Box } from '@utilitywarehouse/web-ui';
import { Link } from '@utilitywarehouse/web-ui/dist/lab';

[...]

<Box>
  <Link>Link</Link>
</Box>
```

2. Import `Lab` directly from Web UI.

```tsx
import { Box, Lab } from '@utilitywarehouse/web-ui';

[...]

<Box>
  <Lab.Link>Link</Lab.Link>
</Box>
// or
const { Link } = Lab
<Box>
  <Link>Link</Link>
</Box>
```

## Size

The size prop controls the size of the `Link`. This is a responsive prop and
can be used to display different sizes at different breakpoints.

<Canvas of={Stories.ResponsiveSize} />

```tsx
<Link
  size={{
    mobile: 'small',
    desktop: 'large',
  }}
/>
```

## With icons

You can nest icons directly inside the `Link`. An appropriate gap is provided
automatically, and the icon will inherit the appropriate colours.

This button is intended to be used with the [UW Icons](https://uw-icons.vercel.app/) packages.
Small links should use 16px icons (small), while large links should use 24px
icons (medium).

```tsx
<Link size="large">
  <SettingsMediumIcon />
  Edit account
</Link>
```

<Canvas of={Stories.WithIcons} />

## Accessibility

Icons from the UW icons packages have `aria-hidden="true"` set by default. If
you are using an icon from outside these packages, and for purely decorative
reasons, please ensure it has this attribute set so that the icon is hidden
from screen readers.

## Semantic HTML

> If it goes somewhere it's a link, if it does something it's a button.

A semantic HTML `a` is rendered by default, however you can change the
underlying HTML element by using the `asChild` prop.

When `asChild` is set to true, we will not render a default DOM element,
instead cloning the child and passing it the props and behaviour required to
make it functional.

Read more about this idea in the [Radix UI composition docs](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/guides/composition).

<Canvas of={Stories.AsButton} />

```tsx
<Link asChild href="https://uw.co.uk/services">
  <button>
    View UW services
    <OpenMediumIcon />
  </button>
</Link>
```

## Full Width Link

Use layout components, like `Flex`, to define your UI layouts.

<Canvas of={Stories.FullWidth} />

```tsx
<Flex direction="column" align="stretch">
  <Link>Link</Link>
</Flex>
```
