# Typography

> This component is only required when building a custom field that isnâ€™t
> provided by UW Web UI, or for backwards compatability with the
> `customer-ui-material` library.

`Typography` is an all purpose component intended for custom typography needs.
Most of the time you should be using `Text` or `Heading`. Typography is not
affected by any Box context and will not change foreground colour acording to
the containing Box background prop value.

## Props

All the [MUI system props](https://mui.com/system/properties/) are available on
this component.

## Deprecated legacy variants

The `variant` prop is currently available for backward compatability with
`customer-ui-material`, but is deprecated and will be removed in the next major
version (`v1`), in favour of the `Text` & `Heading` components.

## Alternatives

- [Heading](?path=/docs/components-heading--documentation) - For heading-level text
- [Text](?path=/docs/components-text--documentation) - For body text

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />
