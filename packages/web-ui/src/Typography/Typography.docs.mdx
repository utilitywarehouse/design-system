# Typography

Typography is an all purpose component intended for custom typography needs.
Most of the time you should be using `Text` or `Heading`. Typography is not
affected by any Box context and will not change foreground colour acording to
the containing Box background prop value.

## Props

All the [MUI system props](https://mui.com/system/properties/) are available on
this component. The `variant` prop is currently available for backward
compatability with Customer Web UI, but is deprecated and will be removed in
the next major version, in favour of the Text & Heading components.

## Alternatives

- [Heading](?path=/docs/components-heading--documentation) - For heading-level text
- [Text](?path=/docs/components-text--documentation) - For body text
