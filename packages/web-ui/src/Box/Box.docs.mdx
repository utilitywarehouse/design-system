# Box

Box is a low-level primitive, which supports theme-aware styling props, and can
be used for building any styled element.

## Semantic HTML

By default Box renders a `div` element, this can be customised using the
`component` prop.

```tsx
<Box component="span">...</Box>
```

## Backgrounds

Additionally to the system properties, Box supports pre-defined backgrounds
that provide visual context to child components. This means that components
will change foreground colour depending on the parent background colour.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Backgrounds" />
</Canvas>
