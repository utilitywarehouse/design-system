'@utilitywarehouse/colour-system': patch
---

This change includes manually created semantic colours for brand and services. These colours duplicate steps in the colour scales generated from Figma. However the risk from this duplication is low as these colours originate from Brand & Creative, and have gained semantic meaning from historical usage which should continue to be supported.
