"@utilitywarehouse/customer-ui-material": patch
---

This change bumps the @mui deps to the latest versions.

This is being done now due to an issue raised where Customer UI styles were not being applied to all components.
This was due to mismatches between @mui dependencies in an application using Customer UI and separately installed versions of the same @mui packages used in Customer UI.
